# DevSecOops

![AI Generated](src/oops.png)

Hi! And welcome to the DevSecOops repository. An educational repository complementary to our [@theredguild/devsecops-toolkit](https://github.com/theredguild/devsecops-toolkit) where we provide practical aid on how to use some of the tools depicted there.

To start, you should have at least built the `workshop-minimal` image of that container.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theredguild/devsecops-toolkit
git checkout workshop-minimal
make exec
```

You should be able to see something similar to this.

    This container was created as a resource for a workshop, 
    which intends to spread awareness, help people protect themselves 
    and the repos they interact with. Say hi @theredguild!, don't be a stranger.

We don't use these tools daily, but they are a selection and a curation of our own after thorough research, testing, and asking around :). If you want more tools, you can checkout `develop` but today in its current state it weights like +10GB.
