# DevSecOops

![AI Generated](src/oops.png)

Hi! And welcome to the DevSecOops repository. An educational repository complementary to our [@theredguild/devsecops-toolkit](https://github.com/theredguild/devsecops-toolkit) where we provide practical aid on how to use some of the tools depicted there.

To start, you should have at least built the `workshop-minimal` image of that container.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theredguild/devsecops-toolkit
git checkout workshop-minimal
make exec
```

You should be able to see something similar to this.

```plaintext

                            Built by The Red Guild ü™∑

    This container was created as a resource for a workshop, 
    which intends to spread awareness, help people protect themselves 
    and the repos they interact with. Say hi @theredguild!, don't be a stranger.

We don't use these tools daily, but they are a selection and a curation of our own after thorough research, testing, and asking around :). If you want more tools, you can checkout `develop` but today in its current state it weights like +10GB.

## GitHub analysis

As you already know, there has been a surge in fake profiles and impersonation in github profiles, contributors, or even backdoored repositories. So here we bring you two tools to help you get some of the basic information you need in order to be able to identify these cases.

### GitXRay

One tool that works out of the box is `gitxray`, by a fellow hacker from the @ekoparty, Lucas.
The only thing I'd suggest doing if you want to actually do a profound analysis, is that by default it uses GH's public access token, so you'll need to add an environment variable when you call it. Othwerwise, to do a shallow an quick analysis you're fine.

In case you want to do it, I'll guest creating a Fine-grained Personal Access Token that expires soon enough, with a representative name and Read Only access to Public Repositories.

```bash
GH_ACCESS_TOKEN="github_pat_11AABCCDDEE13802849209HD09283CDFFF" gitxray -r theredguild/devsecoops -l -v
```

You should see: `GitHub Token Loaded from GH_ACCESS_TOKEN env variable`, this means you're ready to go.

The first time I wanted to play with a tool like this one, was when I spent hours trying to understand what had happened with the xz backdoor, and how much involvement the infiltrator `JiaT75` had in it. The repo is: https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz.

Let's do a basic analysis.

```bash
wanderer@trg ~ $ gitxray -r tukaani-project/xz -l -v
...

We can see JiaT75 appearing second. Let's add that username as a parameter to the previous command I'm going to skip to some of the most interesting parts I want to show you.

```

As you can see, with only some basic parameters we have a lot of data from which we can infer more information to our research. Like for example, where that person might live if their commits were pushed during the workday, or maybe after work.

### GitHub: Fake analyzer

This one allows you to select a username, without the need for a repository or an organization. It just looks through almost anything it can find and creates a JSON report for you to inspect.

Let's start with an example of their repo, running the tool against `eduales99`.

```bash
gh-analyze --token github_pat_11AABCCDDEE13802849209HD09283CDFFF eduales99
```

It begins displaying the requests it is doing, like followers/following, info about their repos, and more, you can check the rest of the log in `script.log`. The report will be found at `out/eduales99/report.json`. You can specify where to ouput the files if you wanted to.

Let's see some of the fields it outputs.

Emails associated with that account from interactions:

```json
    "unique_emails": [
        {
            "email": "eduales9829@gmail.com",
            "name": "eduales99"
        },
        {
            "email": "finaldev.dream119@gmail.com",
            "name": "Never Give Up"
        },
        {
            "email": "noreply@github.com",
            "name": "GitHub"
        },
        {
            "email": "49699333+dependabot[bot]@users.noreply.github.com",
            "name": "dependabot[bot]"
        },
        {
            "email": "121861323+ngud-0119@users.noreply.github.com",
            "name": "NGUD-0119: ACE"
        },
        {
            "email": "finaldev.dream.119@gmail.com",
            "name": "NGUD-0119"
        },
        {
            "email": "156386147+eduales99@users.noreply.github.com",
            "name": "Eduardo Morales Cortes"
        },
        {
            "email": "ortegamontenegrosebastian@gmail.com",
            "name": "sebastian4098"
        }
    ],
```

Repository list, as you can see a lot of web3 projects in there..

```json
"repo_list": [
    "auction-dApp-Ethereum",
    "bancor-protocol-contracts",
    "boilerplate-ethereum",
    "borrowAndrepayNFT",
    "cryptowallet-app",
    "d3-chart",
    "Developer-Dashboard",
    "dfs-token-contracts",
    "eduales99",
    "hardhart-smart-contract",
    "Javascript-Drawio",
    "lottery-contract",
    "TensorFlow-Models",
    "Viking-P2E-Game"
],
```

Even better yet, it shows you direct contributions to their repos:

```json
"contributors": [
    {
        "repo": "auction-dApp-Ethereum",
        "contributors": [
            "eduales99"
        ]
    },
    {
        "repo": "lottery-contract",
        "contributors": [
            "sebastian4098",
            "eduales99"
        ]
    },
```

Contributions to other repositories.

```json
"commits_to_other_repos": [
    {
        "repo": "sebastian4098/portfolio-GASP",
        "commits": [
            "2cf64d2ccb957eb37e6ee86d886f5ba19f268196",
            "a9e0971b14138fbe7baa467256072fd56afbefca"
        ]
    },
    {
        "repo": "sebastian4098/express-server",
        "commits": [
            "97c305583102afb9d904e9dd7b8f941dd926d3ca"
        ]
    }
],
```

From this, we can conclude there might be a relationship between `sebastian4098` and `eduales99`.

Another interesting feature, is the "potential copy" section where it checks if the account was created after commit messages (no fork).

```json
"potential_copy": [
    {
        "repo": "auction-dApp-Ethereum",
        "reason": "account creation date later than the first commit to the repository",
        "commit_date": "2017-07-01T00:13:16-05:00"
    },
    {
        "repo": "bancor-protocol-contracts",
        "reason": "account creation date later than the first commit to the repository",
        "commit_date": "2020-08-07T13:57:17+03:00"
    },
    {
        "repo": "boilerplate-ethereum",
        "reason": "account creation date later than the first commit to the repository",
        "commit_date": "2021-10-31T12:02:11+02:00"
    },
    {
        "repo": "borrowAndrepayNFT",
        "reason": "account creation date later than the first commit to the repository",
        "commit_date": "2022-09-17T23:49:03+09:00"
    },
    ...
]
```

There's much more we can do, and in case something gets deleted or tampered with, we have at least some of that data as a back-up.

Another cool feature it has, is that you can also monitor an account with `gh-monitor`.

```json
wanderer@trg eduales99 $ gh-monitor -u mattaereal # removing token because of space
Starting to monitor activity for users: mattaereal
Press Ctrl+C to stop monitoring.

```

If you're suspicious and want to track the behavior of a specific account, you can check it out. Some cybercriminals change usernames, delete repos, trying to start anew.

### GitHub: Permissions

Sometimes using many repositories and participating in several organizations can be a bit tedious wheen trying to assess permissions. There are some tools that can check them out for you and elaborate a report to let you know where you are weak or someone could leverage permissions.

A tool that does this is Legitify. We're not doing a tutorial about this tool for the workshop because we'd like to focus on more things (and it's not that hard to use).

Also, we don't want you to be in a room fool of hackers trying to create a new access token with this level of permissions on the fly, we might even see you don't use 2FA to change security settings and feel our wrath.

Other tools you could use:

```bash
trufflehog --no-update analyze # and select git/github, pasting your PAT
```

## CI/CD

CI/CD pipelines automate software development but can be exploited if not secured. Attackers may inject malicious code, steal secrets, or escalate privileges, threatening the software supply chain. Securing these pipelines involves enforcing access controls, scanning for vulnerabilities, managing secrets, and integrating security checks to detect issues early and prevent attacks.

For this scenario we're going to use the repository `cicd-goat` from @cider-security-research.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cider-security-research/cicd-goat
```

Since there are many ways on how you can inspect a vulnerable CI/CD, instead of deploying or running each challenge, and because it is not our intention to exploit them, we are going just to scan them to understand how some of these tools work.

### CI/CD: Checkov

In this case we're going to use `checkov`, since it has the possibility to scan many frameworks:

```plaintext
all, ansible, argo_workflows, arm, azure_pipelines, bicep, bitbucket_pipelines, cdk,
circleci_pipelines, cloudformation, dockerfile, github_configuration, github_actions, gitlab_configuration,
gitlab_ci, bitbucket_configuration, helm, json, yaml, kubernetes, kustomize, openapi, sca_package, sca_image,
secrets, serverless, terraform, terraform_json, terraform_plan, sast, sast_python, sast_java, sast_javascript,
sast_typescript, sast_golang, 3d_policy
```

We're going to run it without further configuration just select a folder:

```json
wanderer@trg ~ $ checkov -d cicd-goat/
[ arm framework ]: 100%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà|[44/44], Current File Scanned=../../../gite

... continues
```

You can see the progress bar for each framework being scanned, and then you're going to see how many passed the tests or failed them. In this scenario there's an overload of information given we just fed it a LOT of vulnerable cases.

To avoid this, something you could do is select the quiet and compact view of the output.

```bash
checkov -d cicd-goat --quiet --compact
(trimming some warnings)

terraform scan results:
Passed checks: 32, Failed checks: 19, Skipped checks: 0

Check: CKV_GLB_1: "Ensure at least two approving reviews are required to merge a GitLab MR"
	FAILED for resource: gitlab_project.pygryphon_project
	File: /gitlab/gitlab.tf:73-79
	Guide: https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/policy-reference/build-integrity-policies/gitlab-policies/merge-requests-do-not-require-two-or-more-approvals-to-merge

...

dockerfile scan results:

	Guide: https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/policy-reference/docker-policies/docker-policy-index/ensure-port-22-is-not-exposed
...
continues
```

If you disable `compact`, you will be able to see the vulnerable lines that made the test fail.

And there's much more that you can do, this tools scans for Docker images/files, secrets, and even allows you to plug-in OpenAI to improve the explanations.

Here's an example:

```bash
wanderer@trg ~ $ checkov -d cicd-goat/gitlab-runner/ --quiet --openai-api-key sk-3QqBtfJ...TUV-OWbB
WARNING: About to request 2 enhanced guidelines and it may take up to 15s.

dockerfile scan results:
Passed checks: 31, Failed checks: 2, Skipped checks: 0

Check: CKV_DOCKER_2: "Ensure that HEALTHCHECK instructions have been added to container images"
	FAILED for resource: /Dockerfile.
	Details: The following text is AI generated and should be treated as a suggestion.
	
	         The issue with the provided Dockerfile is that it does not include a HEALTHCHECK instruction.
	         According to the checkov policy 'Ensure that HEALTHCHECK instructions have been added to container images', it is recommended to include a HEALTHCHECK instruction in Dockerfiles to monitor the status of a container.
	
	         To fix this issue, you can add a HEALTHCHECK instruction to the Dockerfile.
	         Here is an example of how you can add a simple HEALTHCHECK instruction to the Dockerfile:
	
	         FROM docker:20.10.21-dind

	         In this example, a simple HTTP health check is added using the `curl` command to check if the container is healthy.

We will leave secrets and container image scanning example to other tools.

### GitHub Actions

There are many many ways you can check the security of your github actions, I'm going to leave you with some basic tools and possibly a few github actions that will hopefully get detected by them.

We are going to use GitHub Actions Goat, a deliberately vulnerable GH actions CI/CD environment, so we don't accidentally find vulnerabilities in live projects by accident :sweat:.

We're going to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/step-security/github-actions-goat
```

#### GitHub: Tindersec's Workflow Auditor

And start by using a tool called **`gh-workflow-auditor`** by @TinderSec. This tool not only scans for actions, but the entire workflow. It looks for malicious or ill-intended inputs, from commits' title messages, to author's name or email fields.

Exporting PAT on the same line, run it like this:

```bash
wanderer@trg ~ $ PAT=github_pat_11ahshdasadasdkjasdhksajdsaj gh-workflow-auditor --type repo step-security-github-actions-goat
```

Since we aren't using a real setup (a repository with commits, issues), and in this case it is only looking through a bunch of yml files, the full potential of the tool is not being exploited.

#### GitHub: Octoscan Static Vuln Scanner

There's also another interesting tool we've found worth mentioning, and it is **`Octoscan`**.

It has two commands, `dl` (download) and `scan`. Let's start with the first one:

```bash
wanderer@trg ~ $ octoscan dl --org theredguild --repo devsecops-toolkit --token github_pat_11AABCCDDEE13802849209HD09283CDFFF
```

If you check your current working directory, you'll see an output folder, where it as inclided for the target repo all the branches' workflows to be analyzed locally.

```bash
wanderer@trg octoscan-output/DevSecOps-toolkit $ ls
ci-moar-space			os-motd
develop				os-pipx-path-and-shell-prompt
docker-compose			readme-docs-1
dockerfile-gosu			readme-todo-list
dockerfile-merge-runs		tool-2ms-and-zsh
docs-create-howto		tool-dockle
docs-readme-motd		tool-hadolint-kics
gha-tests			tool-semgrep-and-reorder
main				tools-clair
misc-dockerfile-make-docs	tools-fixes-1
misc-dockerfile-readme-1	tools-fixes-2
misc-hostname-motd		tools-scoutsuite-checkov-pmapper
multi-dockerfile-readme		tools-versions
multi-tools-pipx-git-asdf-npm	workshop-minimal
multi-tools-snyk-grype-and-more
```

In our case, I know the workflow for each branch is almost the same, except for a few. In order to reduce redundancy, you can delete duplicated workflows by using the `fdupes` command first.

```bash
fdupes -n -r -N -d path/to/repo
```

Now, you can then run a scan directly to the output. Note that if you already have the repository locally, there's no need to download it like we did.

```bash
wanderer@trg ~ $ octoscan scan octoscan-output/theredguild/DevSecOps-toolkit
octoscan-output/theredguild/DevSecOps-toolkit/ci-moar-space/.github/workflows/test-tools.yml:47:27: Expression injection, "steps.**.outputs.**" is potentially untrusted. [expression-injection]
   |
47 |           build-args: ${{ steps.dotenv.outputs.vars }}
   |                           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

You can check all the rules being used by running `octoscan scan --list-rules`, so you may disable the ones you don't need with `--disable rules`. Their documentation suggests to use this command as a first one when you don't know where to start:

```bash
octoscan scan path/to/repos/ --disable-rules shellcheck,local-action --filter-triggers external
```

The [README](https://github.com/synacktiv/octoscan/blob/master/README.md) from Octoscan provides a great explanation with real examples from each of the rules it uses.

There is also a [great guide](https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/) by the Security Lab at GitHub in order to prevent what they call `pwn requests`.

If you want to add an action that proportionates a wide range of security measures, you can start by installing [HardenRunner](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/harden-runner). It provides runtime security for GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners:

```yml
- name: Harden-Runner
  uses: step-security/harden-runner@v2.10.1
```

## Secrets

Secrets, passwords, credentials... you name it. They are everywhere because they are needed. Tokens, API keys, private keys leaks and more are the sole reason of why some projects get rekt. They keep getting pushed to repositories accidentally, or sometimes a colleage pasted it in a Discord channel thinking it might not harm, until someone does a takeover and things scalate quickly.

For this section, we're gonna rely on two repositories. One which aims to be interactive, and also has a [CTF demo](https://wrongsecrets.herokuapp.com/) in case you don't want to set-up your own, which is [wrongsecrets](https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets) by OWASP. The other one is [fake-leaks](https://github.com/leaktk/fake-leaks) by a recent project that aims to integrate all secret scanning tools there are available.

There are many, _many_ tools to scan for secrets, and many ways you can do it. You can scan your code, you can scan your IaC, you can scan your whole repository, or you can even have proactive measures. Things that hook to git commands and prevent you from committing them in the first place. And in case you missed anything, or someone is leaking their credentials through a PR, you can even trigger actions afterward.

### Secrets: Semgrep

We are going to start with Semgrep, which is a powerful, customizable lightweight static analysis tool for many languages. Out of the box works like a charm, but if you login, which is free, you have access to the rest of the rules.

```bash
wanderer@trg ~ $ semgrep login
Login enables additional proprietary Semgrep Registry rules and running custom policies from Semgrep Cloud Platform.
Opening login at: https://semgrep.dev/login?cli-token=abc12345-6789-0123-4567-89abcdef0123&docker=False&gha=False

Once you've logged in, return here and you'll be ready to start using new Semgrep rules.

in /home/wanderer/.semgrep/settings.yml.
Note: You can always generate more tokens at https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/tokens
```

If you use `semgrep ci`, by default it will scan much more than just secrets. Not to deviate from the main topic, we're going to restrict it to what we want. So we will use two generated rules, one by semgrep which is secrets and has many pro rules, and the other a community ruleset based on a popular tool named `gitleaks`. There are many tools that have been ported to semgrep, you'll see!

```bash
wanderer@trg ~ $ semgrep --config "p/secrets" fake-leaks

‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚óã‚óã‚óã ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ Semgrep CLI ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò

METRICS: Using configs from the Registry (like --config=p/ci) reports pseudonymous rule metrics to semgrep.dev.
To disable Registry rule metrics, use "--metrics=off".
Using configs only from local files (like --config=xyz.yml) does not enable metrics.

More information: https://semgrep.dev/docs/metrics


Scanning 205 files (only git-tracked) with 268 Code rules:

üì¢ Too many findings? Try Semgrep Pro for more powerful queries and less noise.

```

We will be using semgrep in other sections as well, since it can parse anything you set your mind to.

### Secrets: 2ms

What we like about 2ms is that it will allow you to scan through different platforms that we haven't seen in other tools, such as: Cnfluence, Discord, and Slack servers; Paligo instances; git repositories and filesystem files/folders.

Everytime you see filesystem and local git repository as options you might think it is the same, but don't forget patterns may benefit one scenario more than other.

Here you can see a difference.

**Filesystem module:**

```bash
wanderer@trg ~ $ 2ms filesystem --path fake-leaks
totalitemsscanned: 205
totalsecretsfound: 584
```

**Git module:**

```bash
wanderer@trg ~ $ 2ms git fake-leaks | less
totalitemsscanned: 275
totalsecretsfound: 649
...
```

A more obvious example when it comes to deciding whether to pick is the following one, and we think with this one you'll get it.

Leaving only the `.git` folder from the repo:

```bash
wanderer@trg fake-leaks-git $ ls -a
.  ..  .git
```

**Filesystem module:**

```bash
wanderer@trg ~ $ 2ms filesystem --path fake-leaks-git
18:23:46 INF Folder plugin started
18:23:46 INF Scan completed with empty content
```

**Git module:**

```bash
wanderer@trg ~ $ 2ms git fake-leaks-git
18:25:12 INF Git plugin started
totalitemsscanned: 275
totalsecretsfound: 649
```

And it will be a little more obvious when you check the sources of the information from where the secret was obtained. In the case of filesystem they will always come from paths, like `source: fake-leaks/test/recipes/30-test_evp_data/evppkey_rsa_common.txt`, and for the git module they may come from things like `git show c4091a5371939a8471a7cfef58497377cb4ec375:specs/github.json`.

### Secrets: Trufflehog

To start with the wizard you can run `sudo trufflehog` and follow the steps! But if you want a specific command, you can run each of them manually. Check `--help` to see them all. You can scan from git, to s3/gcs buckets; docker images, CIs, and even your filesystem.

Note: Make sure to append `--no-update` in order to avoid getting an error while updating to latest version. If you'd like to update you'll need to have root privileges or run it with `sudo`.

To start, you can start a local folder scan using the filesystem feature aimed at the repository we already downloaded. But we warn you, it will show you a lot of output...

```bash
trufflehog --no-update filesystem fake-leaks/
```

If you want to try a smaller scope, and scan a remote git repository, you can try @trufflesecurity's `test_keys` repository.

```bash
trufflehog --no-update git https://github.com/trufflesecurity/test_keys --only-verified
