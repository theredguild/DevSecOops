# Semgrep

We are going to start with Semgrep, which is a powerful, customizable lightweight static analysis tool for many languages. Out of the box works like a charm, but if you login, which is free, you have access to the rest of the rules.

```bash
wanderer@trg ~ $ semgrep login
Login enables additional proprietary Semgrep Registry rules and running custom policies from Semgrep Cloud Platform.
Opening login at: https://semgrep.dev/login?cli-token=abc12345-6789-0123-4567-89abcdef0123&docker=False&gha=False

Once you've logged in, return here and you'll be ready to start using new Semgrep rules.

in /home/wanderer/.semgrep/settings.yml.
Note: You can always generate more tokens at https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/tokens
```

If you use `semgrep ci`, by default it will scan much more than just secrets. Not to deviate from the main topic, we're going to restrict it to what we want. So we will use two generated rules, one by semgrep which is secrets and has many pro rules, and the other a community ruleset based on a popular tool named `gitleaks`. There are many tools that have been ported to semgrep, you'll see!

```bash
wanderer@trg ~ $ semgrep --config "p/secrets" fake-leaks

METRICS: Using configs from the Registry (like --config=p/ci) reports pseudonymous rule metrics to semgrep.dev.
To disable Registry rule metrics, use "--metrics=off".
Using configs only from local files (like --config=xyz.yml) does not enable metrics.

Some files were skipped or only partially analyzed.
  Scan was limited to files tracked by git.
  Partially scanned: 6 files only partially analyzed due to parsing or internal Semgrep errors
  Scan skipped: 9 files matching .semgrepignore patterns
  For a full list of skipped files, run semgrep with the --verbose flag.

Ran 150 rules on 196 files: 103 findings.

📢 Too many findings? Try Semgrep Pro for more powerful queries and less noise.

Now let's give it a try to `gitleaks` port, only showing the summary not to create 

```bash
semgrep --config "p/gitleaks"

We will be using semgrep in other sections as well, since it can parse anything you set your mind to.
