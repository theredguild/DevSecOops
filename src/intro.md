# Introduction

Hi! And welcome to the DevSecOops handbook. An educational approach, complementary to our [@theredguild/devsecops-toolkit](https://github.com/theredguild/devsecops-toolkit) where we provide practical aid on how to use some of the tools depicted there.

To start, you should have at least built the `workshop-minimal` image of that container.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theredguild/devsecops-toolkit
git checkout workshop-minimal
make exec
```

...and be able to see something similar to this.

```plaintext
‚ùØ make exec
fatal: No names found, cannot describe anything.
Running interactive shell inside the devsecops-toolkit container...

    This container was created as a resource for a workshop, 
    which intends to spread awareness, help people protect themselves 
    and the repos they interact with. Say hi @theredguild!, don't be a stranger.

## Disclaimer

As we mentioned above, this is an educational repository, which currently includes the content of this practical handbook. In the future, it may also feature more specific selected examples to test each tool.

Our focus has recently shifted more towards operational security, so we haven't used these tools daily or to their full extent. However, they are a selection and curation of our own after thorough research, testing, and consulting with others :).

If you're looking for more tools, you can check out `develop`, but be aware that in its current state, it weighs over 10GB. The `workshop-minimal` version should not exceed 3.5GB.

Once you've grasped how and where to use them, you might want to explore further to extract all the juice, or even use them separately, most of them include their own separate container.
