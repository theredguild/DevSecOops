# Dependencies

We all rely on them to make our coding lives easier, but sometimes they can bring unexpected issues along for the ride.

When you're building your next big project, those third-party libraries are like trusty sidekicks. But occasionally, they might have vulnerabilities that can sneak into your project and cause trouble. And let's not forget about those sneaky malicious packages that are just waiting to cause a ruckus.

That's why it's crucial to keep an eye on these dependencies and run vulnerability scans. Think of it as a health check-up for your code. By catching these issues early, you can keep your project safe and sound.

We have selected two tools for you to try for this section, the first one is OWASP'S dep-scan, and the second is Dependency-check. We think their name make it pretty obvious they're a great fit for this section, right?
