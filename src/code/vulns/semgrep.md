# Semgrep

You already know we like Semgrep, but in our previous example we just ran it to scan for secrets. Thing is, I did not tell you how amazing it by default:

```bash
wanderer@trg NodeGoat $ semgrep scan .
┌──── ○○○ ────┐
│ Semgrep CLI │
└─────────────┘

Scanning 117 files (only git-tracked) with:

✔ Semgrep OSS
  ✔ Basic security coverage for first-party code vulnerabilities.

✘ Semgrep Code (SAST)
  ✘ Find and fix vulnerabilities in the code you write with advanced scanning and expert security rules.

✘ Semgrep Supply Chain (SCA)
  ✘ Find and fix the reachable vulnerabilities in your OSS dependencies.

💎 Get started with all Semgrep products via `semgrep login`.

          Detected the use of eval(). eval() can be dangerous if used to evaluate dynamic content. If this
          content can be input from outside the program, this may be a code injection vulnerability. Ensure
          evaluated content is not definable by external sources.

Some files were skipped or only partially analyzed.
  Scan was limited to files tracked by git.
  Partially scanned: 12 files only partially analyzed due to parsing or internal Semgrep errors
  Scan skipped: 1 files larger than 1.0 MB, 36 files matching .semgrepignore patterns
  For a full list of skipped files, run semgrep with the --verbose flag.

Ran 259 rules on 80 files: 38 findings.

As you can see, it has a generic ruleset that scans for any kind of vulnerability inside any project. But most rles are restricted unless you log into the platform, which you can do quick and easy as follows:

```bash
wanderer@trg NodeGoat $  semgrep login
Login enables additional proprietary Semgrep Registry rules and running custom policies from Semgrep Cloud Platform.
Opening login at: https://semgrep.dev/login?cli-token=c682a3f1-d734-4b66-bf45-f843b3225dd3&docker=False&gha=False

Once you've logged in, return here and you'll be ready to start using new Semgrep rules.
```

The followoing image will pop up, and when you press activate you're ready. If this is your first time you will need to register.

in /home/wanderer/.semgrep/settings.yml.
Note: You can always generate more tokens at https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/tokens
```

If we run the scanner again, you will see a difference on the amount of rules ran for this project, and in this case, the findings.

```bash
Some files were skipped or only partially analyzed.
  Scan was limited to files tracked by git.
  Partially scanned: 12 files only partially analyzed due to parsing or internal Semgrep errors
  Scan skipped: 1 files larger than 1.0 MB, 36 files matching .semgrepignore patterns
  For a full list of skipped files, run semgrep with the --verbose flag.

Ran 323 rules on 80 files: 41 findings.
```

Remember you can always go look for a custom [community ruleset](https://semgrep.dev/explore), or even [create your own](https://semgrep.dev/learn)!

There's another feature, which I think it's the best, which is `ci`.

```bash
wanderer@trg NodeGoat $ semgrep ci

If you go to the semgrep platform, inside the Projects folder you will see that a local_scan on NodeGoat is In Progress.

This scan, will eventually enable some of their products, download necessary engines to run, and run them. You will be able to see everything beautifully displayed on the web platform.

But as we said, check out the platform!
